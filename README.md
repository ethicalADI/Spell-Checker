### Overview
  Trie is a tree-based data structure, which is used for efficient retrieval of a key in a large dataset of strings. 

  Trie is an efficient information retrieval data structure. Using Trie, search complexities can be brought to optimal limit O(M) 
  (Where M is the maximum string length).
